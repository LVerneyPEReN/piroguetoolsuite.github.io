It can operate in three different modes:
a kiosk mode for anyone who wants to know which servers a mobile device is communicating with
useful for non-profit that want to know if a victim is targeted by stalkerware useful for educational purposes to highlight surveillance capitalism more generally assess if a mobile device is spied on/compromised by utilizing detection rules such as Suricata and others an on-the-field mode</description></item><item><title>Build a PiRogue</title><link>/docs/pirogue/build-a-pirogue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/build-a-pirogue/</guid><description>The hardware you need # In addition to a computer and an Internet connection, you will need, at least, a Raspberry Pi (+ its power supply), a SD-card and an ethernet cable.
Pick a Raspberry Pi # First, you need a Raspberry Pi. We support the following versions of Raspberry Pi:
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B - 2GB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B - 4GB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B - 8GB ðŸ‘‰ Be sure to have an appropriate power supply for your PiRogue.</description></item><item><title>Build a PiRogue hat</title><link>/docs/pirogue/build-a-pirogue-hat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/build-a-pirogue-hat/</guid><description>The current PiRogue case version is v1.0_beta.

3D print a PiRogue case # To 3D print your PiRogue case, you will need:
either the 4 separate STL files or the one containing the 4 part ready the slice a 3D printer PLA or PETG Recommended printing parameters # layer height: 0.2 mm infill: 20% no support material: PETG The entire printing lasts around 3 hours for a complete case.</description></item><item><title>Operate a PiRogue</title><link>/docs/pirogue/operate-a-pirogue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/operate-a-pirogue/</guid><description>Find your PiRogue on the network # Once your PiRogue is running, it will be accessible to you from the network. There are 2 ways to get the IP address of your PiRogue.
The first way is by looking at the screen of the PiRogue Hat.
The second way is to use the ping command. To do so, on your computer connected to the same network as your PiRogue, run the following command:</description></item><item><title>Cheatsheet</title><link>/docs/pirogue/cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/cheatsheet/</guid><description>Default configuration # Name Value Example of usage SSH port 22 ssh -p22 pi@&amp;lt;PiRogue IP address&amp;gt; SSH user pi SSH password raspberry Dashboard port 3000 http://&amp;lt;PiRogue IP address&amp;gt;:3000 Dashboard user admin Dashboard password PiRogue Wi-Fi SSID PiRogue1 Wi-Fi password superlongkey Chronograph port 8888 http://&amp;lt;PiRogue IP address&amp;gt;:8888 Important files # Name Location SSH configuration /etc/ssh/sshd_config Suricata configuration /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml Suricata rules /var/lib/suricata/rules/suricata.rules PiRogue screen /etc/pirogue/pirogue_infos_screen.py</description></item><item><title>Useful commands</title><link>/docs/pirogue/useful-commands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/pirogue/useful-commands/</guid><description>Find the IP address of your PiRogue # On your computer connected to the same network as your PiRogue, run the following command:
